      "King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of Welsh and English folklore and literary invention, and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. These sources mention a Romano-British leader named Arthur who fought against the Saxons in the late 5th or early 6th centuries. However, they provide little detail about Arthur's life or deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first full-length account of Arthur's story appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), written in the late 12th century. Geoffrey's work is a fanciful account of British history, and it is largely responsible for the popular conception of Arthur as a heroic king who led a Round Table of knights in a series of chivalric adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur's story has been retold and embellished by countless writers over the centuries. He has been the subject of poems, plays, novels, and films. He has been portrayed as a warrior, a lover, a statesman, and a magician. He has been seen as a symbol of British national identity and as a champion of the oppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur's story is a complex and fascinating one. It is a story that has been told and retold for centuries, and it continues to capture the imagination of people all over the world.\n",

      "The Knights of the Round Table were a group of legendary knights who served King Arthur. The Round Table was a symbol of equality, as all the knights were seated at the same table, regardless of their rank or status. The knights were bound by a code of chivalry, which emphasized honor, courage, and loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most famous Knights of the Round Table include Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Sir Percival, and Sir Galahad. These knights were known for their bravery, their skill in battle, and their devotion to King Arthur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knights of the Round Table are a popular subject of Arthurian legend. They have been featured in countless poems, plays, novels, and films. They are often seen as symbols of chivalry and the ideals of knighthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the most famous Knights of the Round Table:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sir Lancelot: Lancelot is the most famous of the Knights of the Round Table. He is a skilled warrior and a loyal friend to King Arthur. However, he is also known for his love affair with Guinevere, Arthur's wife.\n",
      "* Sir Gawain: Gawain is another of Arthur's most trusted knights. He is a brave and skilled warrior, but he is also known for his recklessness.\n",
      "* Sir Percival: Percival is a young knight who is on a quest to find the Holy Grail. He is a pure and innocent soul, but he is also naive and inexperienced.\n",
      "* Sir Galahad: Galahad is the son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic. He is the purest and most virtuous of the Knights of the Round Table. He is the only knight who is able to find the Holy Grail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knights of the Round Table are a fascinating group of characters. They are brave, skilled, and loyal, but they are also flawed and human. They are a reminder that even the greatest heroes are capable of making mistakes.\n"
