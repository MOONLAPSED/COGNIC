In this YAML representation:

- `entities` is the main list containing definitions for each entity.
- Each entity definition includes a `name` and `type` field, representing the entity's name and type.
- The `attributes` field contains a list of attributes associated with the entity.
- For entities that are mind maps, the `elements` field lists the elements within the mind map, and the `edges` field describes the relationships between those elements.
