# Guidelines for Creating Informative and Self-contained {Prompt} Objects

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive guidelines for creating informative and self-contained {prompt} objects for various alternative purposes. The focus is on producing {prompt} objects that are tailored to specific tasks or domains and can be used effectively in generating AI chatbot responses with instructions and constraints. The use of structured data formats like JSON is encouraged to enhance interactions and improve the consistency of messages, fostering clearer conversations and facilitating easier recall of key details.

## Key Considerations for Prompt Engineering

When creating {prompt} objects, several key considerations should be taken into account:

1. **Understand the Specific Purpose and Requirements**: Clearly define the purpose of the {prompt} and identify the target domain(s) it will serve, such as Prompt Engineering, Prompt Generation, NLP tasks, or AI assistance. This understanding is crucial for tailoring the {prompt} effectively.

2. **Clarity, Specificity, and Context**: Ensure that the {prompt} is well-defined, specific, and contextually rich to provide sufficient information for generating desired responses. Avoid ambiguity and vagueness in the {prompt}.

3. **Incorporate Necessary Data and Context**: Include all relevant data and context within the {prompt} object, which may involve using variables and placeholders to represent dynamic elements.

4. **Address Potential Biases and Variations**: Be mindful of potential biases or variations in the {prompt} that may influence the generated responses. Provide guidelines on how to handle these biases and variations appropriately.

5. **Explicit Instructions and Guidelines**: Clearly specify the instructions and constraints for generating responses based on the {prompt}. Ensure that the AI model knows the boundaries and limitations.

6. **Structured Data Formats**: Utilize structured data formats like JSON to represent the {prompt} object. Consistent naming conventions, nesting, and comments can enhance readability and understanding.

## How to Ensure Inclusion of Necessary Data and Context

To ensure that a {prompt} object includes all the necessary data and context, follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables and Placeholders**: Identify the dynamic elements in the {prompt} that require specific values during generation. Represent these elements as variables or placeholders.

2. **Provide Examples and Data Sources**: If applicable, offer examples of data or entities that can fill the variables or placeholders. You can also reference external data sources to populate these elements.

3. **Contextual References**: Refer to relevant information from previous questions or interactions within the {prompt} object to maintain context and coherence.

4. **Use Structured Data Formats**: Use JSON or other structured formats to organize and represent the data and context effectively. Follow the rules of thumb mentioned earlier to create a clear and concise structure.

## Guidelines for Addressing Potential Biases and Variations

To address potential biases and variations in {prompt} objects, follow these guidelines:

1. **Diverse Training Data**: Ensure that the AI model is trained on a diverse and unbiased dataset to reduce biases in responses.

2. **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Implement bias mitigation techniques during training or utilize post-processing approaches to address any observed biases.

3. **Controlled Language**: Employ controlled language and instructions in the {prompt} to steer the AI model away from generating biased or inappropriate responses.

4. **Contextual Sensitivity**: Make the {prompt} sensitive to context, so the generated responses align with the intent and appropriateness for different scenarios.

5. **Bias Testing and Validation**: Regularly test and validate the responses from the {prompt} to identify and rectify any unintended biases.

## Strategies for Providing Explicit Instructions and Guidelines

To provide explicit instructions and guidelines within a {prompt} object, follow these strategies:

1. **Precise Language**: Use clear and

 concise language to express the instructions and constraints. Avoid ambiguity or vagueness that could lead to misinterpretation.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Break down complex tasks or requirements into step-by-step instructions to guide the AI model's responses effectively.

3. **Boundary Definitions**: Clearly define the boundaries and limitations within which the AI model should operate. Specify what is allowed and what is not allowed in the generated responses.

4. **Example Usage**: Provide examples of correct usage and expected responses to demonstrate the desired behavior.

5. **Error Handling**: Include instructions on how to handle potential errors or unexpected situations. Define fallback options or alternative instructions.

6. **Documentation and References**: Include relevant documentation, guidelines, or references within the {prompt} object to assist users in understanding and following the instructions effectively.

## Examples of Existing High-quality {Prompt} Objects

Here are a few examples of existing high-quality {prompt} objects that can serve as references:

1. **Customer Support {Prompt} Object**:

    "purpose": "Generating customer support responses",
    "target_domain": "Customer service",
    "instructions": "Provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance for common issues faced by customers."
  },
  "context": "The purpose of this {prompt} object is to assist AI models in generating accurate and helpful responses to customer support queries.",
  "variables": {
    "issue_type": ["connectivity", "billing", "product"],
    "troubleshooting_steps": ["Check connections", "Restart the device", "Update software"]
  }
}
```

2. **Code Refactoring {Prompt} Object**:
```
{
  "data": {
    "purpose": "Generating refactoring suggestions for code",
    "target_domain": "Software development",
    "instructions": "Identify and suggest code refactorings to improve performance and maintainability."
  },
  "context": "This {prompt} object aims to guide AI models in generating actionable code refactoring recommendations.",
  "variables": {
    "code_snippet": "<INSERT CODE SNIPPET HERE>"
  }
}
```

3. **Legal Document Analysis {Prompt} Object**:
```
{
  "data": {
    "purpose": "Generating insights from legal documents",
    "target_domain": "Legal industry",
    "instructions": "Analyze legal contracts for potential risks and highlight critical clauses."
  },
  "context": "This {prompt} object facilitates AI models in extracting valuable information from legal documents.",
  "variables": {
    "document_text": "<INSERT LEGAL DOCUMENT TEXT HERE>"
  }
}
```

Please note that the above examples are just illustrative and may require further customization to suit specific needs.

#### A [{PROMPT}] guides ai chatbot responses with instructions and constraints. Some of the main means of doing so are:
 - Using [{VARIABLES}], which should either stand-in or automatically be replaced by 'values' as they are enumerated/evaluated/formulated. 
 - Each instance of a properly formatted [{INSTRUCTIVE_PROMPT}] is a [PROMPT] object which contains everything required to perform one [{OPERATION}].
 - An [OPERATION] represents the 'result' of a cognitive [{ITERATION}] resultant of a Train-of-Thought of an [{AGENT}] which was instantiated or is being instantiated by a [PROMPT]. 
 - Definititionally, a specific [OPERATION] must be proceeded by a specific [PROMPT] carried out by a particular [ITERATION], or invocation, of a specific [AGENT].
 - Due to the chronological and ordered nature of operations laid out by a previous or even this very [PROMPT]; a specific [OPERATION] representing a single [ITERATION] of an [AGENT]'s train-of-thought must necessarilly be proceeded by a [PROMPT] and some amount of [{CONTEXT}].
 - The [CONTEXT] of any given [ITERATION] which governs each possible [OPERATION] is of PARAMOUNT importance. 
 - Other than the specific [PROMPT] itself, the specific [CONTEXT] is the most important or heavily weighted factor when generating an ultimate [{RETURN}] or when generating the specific [{TRAIN OF THOUGHT}].
 - To fufill the requirements of each specific [ITERATION]; Invoke the final [RETURN] using the formatting provided only after outputting [TRAIN OF THOUGHT] functionally required for each and every [RETURN].
 - Given the object-oriented paradigm laid out in each [PROMPT]; the task involves passing plain text as parameters and returning plain text.
 - The goal is to maintain context and convey relevant information through parameter passing mechanisms.
#### Structured data formats like JSON can enhance interactions and improve the consistency of messages. 
They provide a way to represent data and metadata within text strings. Descriptors, comments, and indentation can further clarify content, and code can be denoted using backticks. Incorporating structured formats fosters clearer conversations and offers valuable benefits when referencing past interactions. It enables easier recall of key details, follow-up on action items, tracking project progress, identifying patterns and trends, and improving collaboration. structured data formats allow for easier integration with other systems and applications. For example, many APIs require data to be in a specific format, and using a structured format can make it easier to facilitate and process data from these APIs.
#### To create a clear structure, consider the following **rules of thumb**:
1. Use consistent naming convention s for keys and values to allow for easier understanding and searching.
2. Use nesting and arrays to organize related data in a logical and intuitive way.
3. Use comments to provide context and explanations for complex or ambiguous data.
4. Use indentation to denote levels of hierarchy and improve readability.
5. Use backticks to denote code or programming language syntax.
6. Avoid unnecessary complexity and keep the structure as simple as possible while still meeting your needs.
7. Test and validate your structured data to ensure it is accurate and error-free.
8. If presented a data structure, one should respond with a data structure.<|EOS|>
