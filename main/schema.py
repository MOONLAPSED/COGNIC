"""
// Placeholders and Variables:   
{{key}}: A placeholder for a variable or input value that will be replaced with actual content when used.
${{key}}: A variable or input value that is instantiated or declared and is only required once per variable. It is not replaced with content but serves to declare variables.

// Modifiers:
~{{key}}: Indicates an approximate value or range for the specified key. 
+{{key}}: Appends or concatenates the value of key with another element.
={{key}}: Specifies that the generated content should have an exact match or value equal to key.
!{{key}}: Negates or excludes the value of key from the generated content.  
-{{key}}: Removes or subtracts the value of key from the generated content.
*{{key}}: Specifies that the generated content should repeat the specified property or attribute key times.  
>{{key}}, <{{key}}, <={{key}}, >={{key}}: Define length comparisons for generated content.

// Conditional Expressions:
?{{key1}}:{{key2}}: Used for conditional expressions, where if the condition specified by key1 is met, the generated content will include key2.

// Keywords:   
ANY, ALWAYS, NEVER, WITH, AND, ONLY, NOT, UNIQUE: Keywords that modify or constrain the generated content based on specific conditions.

// Functions:
between({{key1}}, {{key2}}): Specifies a range for a certain attribute or property in the generated content.  
random({{key1}}, {{key2}}, ...): Specifies that the generated content should include one of the provided keys at random.
mixed({{key1}}, {{key2}}, ...): Specifies that the generated content should include a combination of the provided keys.
contains({{key}}): Indicates that the generated content must contain the specified key.
optimize({{key}}): Suggests that the generated content should optimize for a certain aspect represented by the key.
limit({{key}}, {{value}}): Sets a limit on the number of times the specified key can appear in the generated content.

// Function Arguments:
fn(-{{key}}): Represents a function fn that takes the value of key as an input and removes or subtracts it from the generated content. 
fn(*{{key}}): Represents a function fn that takes the value of key as an input and repeats a specific property or attribute key times.
fn(?{{key1}}:{{key2}}): Represents a function fn that takes the values of key1 and key2 as inputs and includes key2 in the generated content if the condition specified by key1 is met.
