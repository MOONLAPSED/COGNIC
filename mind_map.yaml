- Conversational Mind Mapping Guidelines:
    - Overview:
            - Conversational mind mapping involves utilizing a graph-type object, referred to as the mind map, to enhance the structure and effectiveness of conversations.
                    - The mind map acts as a rhizomatic cognitive architecture, facilitating organized and actionable discussions.
                            - It's important to distinguish that the mind map itself is not the output or response text; rather, it serves as a strategic framework.

                                - Importance of Structured Data:
                                        - Structured data and a {'key': 'value'} format should be employed in every `Return:` statement.
                                                - This structured approach fosters clearer conversations and provides several benefits:
                                                            - Improved recall of key details and action items.
                                                                        - Enhanced project progress tracking and pattern recognition.
                                                                                    - Facilitated collaboration and integration with other systems through standardized formats.
                                                                                            - The use of structured data enables the seamless cross-domain learning necessary for in-context responses.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                        - Structured Format Guidelines:
                                                                                                                - Consistency in naming conventions for keys and values enhances understanding and searchability.
                                                                                                                        - Organize related data using nesting and arrays for logical flow.
                                                                                                                                - Context-explaining comments and indentation clarify complexity.
                                                                                                                                        - Denote code or syntax with backticks; maintain simplicity while addressing needs.
                                                                                                                                                - Apply the principle: respond with a data structure when presented with one.
                                                                                                                                                        - Following these guidelines creates organized and actionable conversations.
